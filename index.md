## HoTin Hung, *go by Sky* 
- University of California, San Diego
- Bachelor of Science
- Major: Computer Engineering

I am a forth-year computer engineering student who is interested in digital circuits, neuromorphic computing, and internet-of-things (IoT).

I come from Hong Kong, and now lives in San Diego. Hong Kong is a really beautiful city! (For more about HK: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong]) I have a variety of hobbys including reading, traveling, video gaming, archery, philosophy, and fantasy literature. An interesting fact about me is that I speak four languages!

As an engineer, my goal is to become a distinguished engineer in the sector of electrical and computer engineering. My interest fall more in the fields of hardware, so I would not say I am a programmer. However, software engineering is still an attractive career path for me, and possessing strong skills in software and programming is definitely indispensable for working in electrical-related fields!

## Courses I am taking this quarter are:
1. CSE 110
2. CSE 101
3. ECE 158A
4. LIGN 8

> By the end of this course, I wish I can:
> - [ ] Know the basic skills and tools of software engineering
> - [ ] Improve my ability of working in large groups
> - [ ] Be more prepared for future work in industry
